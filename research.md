# PhD Research
My research examines if digital technologies are changing the nature of economic competition by enabling larger firms to achieve greater levels of market power and profitability.

## Central research question
Are digital technologies changing the nature of economic competition by enabling larger firms to achieve greater levels of market power and profitability?

## Hypotheses 
- Levels of market power are increasing in advanced economies (as evidenced by increased concentration, higher profitability, lower business dynamism and greater productivity dispersion).
- These trends are more prevalent in technology intensive sectors. 
- This may be driven the characteristics of digital technologies, and intangible assets more generally. Both digital and intangible assets have a number of characteristics that may make them more impactful in larger firms. 
- These changes are altering competitive dynamics by reducing some of the traditional diseconomies of scale and enhancing some of the traditional benefits. This is resulting in greater returns to scale than seen previously. 
- Changes in public policy may be required to address the imbalances.
